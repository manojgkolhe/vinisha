      <h2>swimming</h2>
      <p>
        I really like swimming beacause it's relaxing and it is enteraining too!
        I have been practicing it for 2 years my favourite skill is front roll
        as it can make you go faster. Also, in swimming theres this move
        called"star' which you go on your back and float like a star.
